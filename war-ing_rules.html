<p style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bolder">War-ing V2</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">You will be familiar with the basic rules if you have played before, but there are many additions into this game, and please read through all of them.</p>
<p style="font-size:large; font-weight:600"><u>Introduction</u></p>
<p>1. At the start, excluding you, there will be 7 other people competing. <b>(You may choose your nation if it is far away from other people or if it isn't taken yet. If you don't choose, you will have a random nation.)</b> The players would be equally farther apart so it would be fair.</p>
<p>2. In the space between you and your opponents, there would be bots. These bots are like your stepping stone to fight your actual opponents, and a great chance to build up your army and conquer land. <b>These bots will NOT be hard to beat.</b></p>
<p>3. The goal of the game is to either conquer the whole world, or to survive in the 1 month time limit. (The limit might be changed later on.)</p>
<p style="font-size:large; font-weight:600">Basic Concepts</p>
<p>1. First the time span of ONE turn is ONE day. In this time, you can create more troops, gain resources for that day, or to move your troops by one square to attack.</p>
<p>2. If your base is destroyed, you are now dead. You have to give all of your remaining troops to your opponent.</p>
<p>3. Different from the original War-ing, Each of you guys will have a status board, with your troops and base. Other people will <b>NOT</b> have access to these status boards, and the main mao is there for reference. So, other people would <b>NOT</b> be able to see your troops, unless you go into another person's territory. (But you can buy spies, which you can locate the opponent's troops.)
